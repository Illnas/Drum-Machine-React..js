Drum Machine React.js


And here we are, third project done!

Let's see, we learned how to make valid state and props and actually be able to use it! I will admit, I did make
code without it in order to see what I need to pass and what I don't need to pass. Then I did simple click event 
which played out sound! This is first part where I just did not know what to do. After all play() was something
I never encountered so far. After fumbling and making it work, I got stuck at keyPressDOwn events. This took me some
time to read upon, and actually check many other examples of key events before I got it right. If anything else, 
at least now I have reference, in case I might need it later.

Anyway, gonna go and read requirements of the fourth project and start doing it tomorrow.

See ya!
